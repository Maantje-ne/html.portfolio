<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My father has his own company for making websites and he is very good at it and if you look at what he makes,
   it is much more than this, but I look up to him and I would like it if I could join him come to work</p>

<p>So far I really enjoy doing this, but sometimes it is difficult, but with the
   help of my dad I get through it. I'm twelve, which is quite young, but I'm very passionate about it and I do 
   it as often as I can, which means if I have time, that happens quite often, but it can sometimes happen.</p>

<p>I live in the Netherlands I am twelve I like to climb and eat fruit and
   ice cream but I start school again in a few months so things will be less</p>
